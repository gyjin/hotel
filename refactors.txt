Refactors I've done so far:

1. Added a room.all method, instead of initializing all room instances 
  inside of the ReservSystem initialization
2. Removed the DateRange class because it was not being used much. 
  Most of the string-to-Date conversion was being done elsewhere 


Refactors I would like to do: 

1. A lot of my tests seem redundant. While I want to make sure every
  possible scenario is covered and that my code is doing what I want it
  to, I may be able to cut some out
  - use let instead of before/do
2. The reserv_system class has some bulky methods. Not sure at the 
  moment if I could remove some of the responsibilities in each to
  its own method, but want to look into it more
3. Will need to complete wave-3, adding hotel blocks
  - potentially add a subclass to Reservation class, or make it its own 
    class with object composition 
4. I just realized I didn't put in any errors for wrong input
  - incorrect start/end time formats, data types
  - tests to make sure these are being caught
